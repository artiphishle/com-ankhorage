### 📝 Code formatting

Let's stick to `eslint-plugin-google` to begin with.

```

Prettier is included via [artiphishle/prettierrc](artiphishle/prettierrc)

```bash

To run both of the above scripts:

```bash
# Works in any Ankhorage project
yarn format
```

I'm happy to start by supporting GitHub Actions.

# Works in any Ankhorage project
yarn ci
```
